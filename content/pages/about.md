I'm a husband, dad, church leader, and businessman.

[arise my son](/) is a blog that focuses on these four aspects of my life as I reflect on my journey in Christian manhood. I want to be intentional in each of these areas - to excel in what God has called me to.

_Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters_ - Colossians 3:23

[#husband](/husband) - being a husband submitted to God who would lay down his life for his wife

[#father](/father) - being a great dad, who leads his family through service

[#church](/church-leader) - being in fellowship with other believers

[#business](/business) - being great in the workplace, whatever the setting

#### Being a great husband
>_Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church_ - Ephesians 5:25-30

#### Being a great father
>_Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it._ - Proverbs 22:6

>_Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord._ - Ephesians 6:4

#### Being a great church leader
>_For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ._ -1 Corinthians 12:12

#### Being great in the workplace
>_Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters_ - Colossians 3:23
