At the time I was\n18, in my final year of high school. I literally used twitter as an\noutlet to vent all of my feelings, happy or sad. I dropped a few f bombs\nhere and there. I complained about various things like telcos, sydney\ntrains and broken electronics. I use it to talk/meet new people, in fact\nI had a relationship with someone I met on twitter for about 4 years. I\nliterally tweeted about anything and everything.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2020, we now live in a world where your past can come\nback and haunt you, just about anyone can be a detective and dig through\nyour past. I had accumulated well over 30k tweets over the years and its\nphysically not possible to remember every one of them or every single\nphoto I have posted. There is one thing for sure, the old me was dumb\nand naive. I actually don’t mind the silliness and embarrassing selfies\nbut what I can not handle is an innocent tweet being turned into a\nsomething more sinister. There is also an excellent TEDTalk ”\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAIP6fI0NAI\">How one tweet can ruin your life</a>”\nby Jon Ronsons that talks about this. Its well worth a watch.</p>\n<p>So how to delete tweets? You can do it manually via the UI and do it one\nby one or use one of the are many services out there that would delete\nyour old timeline items. Most of them are on a freemium model such as\n<a href=\"https://tweetdelete.net/\">tweetdelete</a>,\n<a href=\"http://twitwipe.com/\">twitwipe</a> and\n<a href=\"https://tweetdeleter.com/\">tweetdeleter</a>. Using these services requires\nyou to sign into your twitter account so please check their privacy\nstatements before using those services. Or finally you can write a\nscript like I did.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/hbish/delete-old-tweets\">delete-old-tweets</a> is a\nopen-source script I wrote almost three years ago to go through your\ntwitter archives and remove the tweets from your timeline. You can\nspecify a cutoff date so any tweets before that date would be deleted\nfrom your timeline. You can follow the instructions on the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/hbish/delete-old-tweets/blob/master/README.md\">README.md</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/b2b08671d3ac4d92b5eef2c3cd6517d3/benshi.gif\" alt=\"Ben Shi GIF\"></p>\n<p>Why the gif? This was actually a result of a series of prank wars in the\noffice with a former colleague, the person actually dug through my\ntwitter timeline all the way back till 2011 and found a series of\nembarrassing selfies I took and stitched them together to make a\n:benshi: gif. While I wasn’t very happy about it at the time, we laugh\nover it now.</p>\n<p>Next time you post something on the internet, just remember</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once on the internet, always stays on the internet.</p>\n</blockquote>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"Deleting Old Tweets","date":"June 07, 2020","categories":null,"tags":["programming","twitter","history"]},"fields":{"slug":"/deleting-old-tweets/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/deleting-old-tweets/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/brief-look-at-webmention/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Brief Look at WebMention","type":"post","url":"/brief-look-at-webmention/"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/modding-keychron-k2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Modding the Keychron K2 Mechanical Keyboard","type":"post","url":"/modding-keychron-k2/"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1272777910","2240159121","2581348398"]}
