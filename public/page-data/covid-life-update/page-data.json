During this time I had the privilege to work\nacross industries from financial services, governments to airlines. I\nlead those projects responsible for the design and implementation of\nAPIs and microservices. I have had my fair shares of WTF moments while\nworking in consulting but that’s a story for another time.</p>\n<p>After a fair amount of project work and reinventing the wheel if you\nwill, the speed at which I personally operated has started to wear on\nme. While the hours I worked were pretty normal, but the stress to\ndeliver and keeping the clients happy were getting to me. The onboarding\nprocess, getting to know new people (not only within the consulting\ncompany but also clients), understanding how they operate and their\nskills all took significant effort. So imagining repeating this process\nevery 3-6 months as you start/finish the projects and moving on to\nanother.</p>\n<p>I made an internal move to the product team towards the end of my tenure\nto help build out a plug-n-play identity and access management system.\nThe team and the tech stack used on the project were top-notch. I was\nnot on client site anymore and rather than reinventing the wheel, we are\nmaking the wheel better, faster and strong. All perks of working on a\nproduct team.</p>\n<p>Around August of 2019, I found out a close friend of mine joined a new\ncompany and they have an open position for an Engineering Manager role.\nAt the time I didn’t want to move off the tools and move into management\njust yet. But after some careful consideration, I decided to have a chat\nand find out more about the opportunity (never turn down an\nopportunity). I didn’t know what I was expecting, after all, I have\nnever sat in an engineering manager interview previously, all I had was\nmy prior experiences of leading engineering teams and consulting. To my\nsurprise, the chat went super smoothly and I got offered the position on\nthe spot.</p>\n<h3 id=\"that-didnt-last\" style=\"position:relative;\">That didn’t last…<a href=\"#that-didnt-last\" aria-label=\"that didnt last permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>A month later I found myself in unfamiliar territory as an Engineering\nManager of a fintech startup (it still sounds a little funny when I say\nit out loud and introduce myself). At the time we had about 12 engineers\nand more than half of them only started within the last 6 months. I\nguess you can say the company was in a hyper-growth stage.</p>\n<p>I hit the ground running immediately and applied a lot of what I have\nlearnt in the past. I also picked up precious knowledge on managing\nsoftware teams and scaling (future posts). Everything was going along\nfine, the team grew to close to 20 people and I was starting to find my\nrhythm until…COVID-19.</p>\n<p>On 25th March, I received the unfortunate news along with the rest of\nthe company that everyone’s role has been made redundant. I still\nremember this day vividly and I’m sure everyone there would as well. The\nnews was delivered to the entire company via Zoom, since only a week\nprior, we were all asked to work from home due to the strict lockdown\nlaws.</p>\n<p>I was shocked. Although I found out about the news earlier than the rest\nof the company, it didn’t make the news any less shocking. The worst\npart is watching people’s reaction over a computer screen. There were\nlots of supportive messages for the CEO and the company at the\nannouncement. As they try to seek additional funding to bring the\ncompany back from suspended animation. Like anyone who has been told\ntheir job is no longer available, I updated my resume and decided to put\nmyself on the job market again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"or-did-it\" style=\"position:relative;\">Or did it?<a href=\"#or-did-it\" aria-label=\"or did it permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>I was SUPER conflicted. I had an important decision to make, whether I\ncontinue down the managerial route or if I should get back on the tools.\nThe different paths would have a different lead-time, preparation and\nsteer my career in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>The job market was dead slow at the start of April and there were a lot\nof companies going through the same fate as mine. Companies hiring were\nforced to tighten spend and freeze unnecessary hires. It has picked up\nsince then as companies start to accept the status quo and begin to live\nwith the fact that COVID-19 is here to stay.</p>\n<p>Around mid-April, the Australian Government announced the\n<a href=\"https://www.business.gov.au/Risk-management/Emergency-management/Coronavirus-information-and-support-for-business/JobKeeper-Payment-for-employers-and-employees\">JobKeeper</a>\nprogram, its aimed at helping employees stay in jobs and take the burden\noff Australia’s welfare system. As a result of this, some of us were\nasked to come back on a part-time basis to keep the ship going while the\nfounders try to secure the funding. This made my decisions a lot easier\nand I was not forced to make a career decision out of my hand.</p>\n<p>While the development team is a lot smaller now and things are still not\nback to normal for a lot of us. I am getting a lot more positive about\nthe situation as I continue to receive news of people who are no longer\nwith the company locking in full-time employment or other forms of\nfreelance work.</p>\n<p>Working part-time also meant that I have got a lot of free time on my\nhands. I find myself reading and coding a lot more. I am waiting for the\nlockdown to ease further. When that happens, I’m sure everyone will meet\nup and catch-up on everything over a beer or two in a pub.</p>\n<p>So that’s where I am now, I’m optimistic the world will start to recover\nand everything will hopefully get back to normal by the end of the year.</p>","timeToRead":5,"frontmatter":{"title":"COVID Life Update","date":"May 17, 2020","categories":null,"tags":["life","covid-19","career"]},"fields":{"slug":"/covid-life-update/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/covid-life-update/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/brief-look-at-webmention/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Brief Look at WebMention","type":"post","url":"/brief-look-at-webmention/"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1272777910","2240159121","2581348398"]}
