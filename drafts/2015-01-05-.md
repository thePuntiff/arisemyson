I remember back in university

> **Individuals and Interactions** over Processes and Tools

> **Working Software** over Comprehensive Documentation

> **Customer Collaboration** over Contract Negotiation, and

> **Responding to Change** over Following a Plan

I suggest you all to have a read of "_Agile is Dead (Long Live Agility)_" by [Dave Thomas][1] who discuss this in much more detail.
